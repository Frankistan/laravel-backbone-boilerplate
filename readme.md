#Laravel/Backbone/Sass Boiler Plate.

This is a personal project that has everything in place that I would normally set-up manually for a new App.

##Backend
 - Laravel PHP framework (complete with example migration, controllers, routes, views and models)
##Frontend
The setup for the front-end is quite opinionated, but consists of my most used tools/libraries.

 - Sass/Compass support (using Grunt)
 - Inuit css framework (light-weight, style-less, oocss, scss)
 - JS Package management through Jam
 - Backbone, Underscore, jQuery, Modernizr
 - Testing with Jasmine
 - All JS loaded as modules with RequireJS (including tests)

If anyone ever finds this, and would like help getting it up and running, just give me a shout.
